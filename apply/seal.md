**Journals do not need to meet the Seal criteria to be accepted into DOAJ.**

There are extra criteria which may make the journal eligible for the DOAJ Seal for best practice. The Seal is awarded to journals that meet additional best practice recommendations based on seven criteria relating to accessibility, openness, discoverability, reuse, and authors rights.

All seven criteria must be met to be awarded the Seal:

1. [Digital archiving and preservation](https://blog.doaj.org/2015/01/28/applications-a-note-about-archiving-and-preservation/): the journal content must be actively deposited in one of the DOAJ-approved services:
  - CINES
  - CLOCKSS
  - Internet Archive
  - LOCKSS
  - PKP PN
  - PMC/Europe PMC/PMC Canada
  - Portico
  - A national library
2. Permanent identifiers, e.g. DOI, ARK, Handle:
  - identifiers must be deposited regularly and must resolve;
3. Metadata supply to DOAJ:
  - article metadata must be upload to DOAJ regularly and within three months of receiving the Seal;
4. Embedded CC license information in full-text articles:
  - the licensing information must be visible in all full-text formats;
5. Use of CC BY, CC BY-SA or CC BY-NC license, allowing the creation of derivative products;
6. A repository policy—allowing authors to deposit a copy of their work—indicated in one of the following ways:
  - Registered with one of these services:
    - SHERPA/RoMEO
    - Dulcinea
