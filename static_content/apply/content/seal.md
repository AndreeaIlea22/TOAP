The DOAJ Seal may be awarded to journals that demonstrate best practice in open access publishing. Currently around 10% of journals listed in DOAJ have been awarded the Seal.

**Journals do not need to meet the Seal criteria to be accepted into DOAJ.**

There are seven criteria which a journal must meet to be eligible for the DOAJ Seal. These relate to best practice in long term preservation, use of permanent identifiers, discoverability, reuse policies and authors' rights.
