DOAJ adheres to the [BOAIâ€™s definition of open access](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess).

This means that users are permitted

> to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.
