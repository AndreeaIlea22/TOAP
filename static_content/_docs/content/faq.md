### I know a journal which should be in DOAJ but isn’t. What should I do?

  Contact the journal and ask them to submit an application. You can also send us the details of the journal—title and ISSN—and we will contact them.

### The journal I am looking for isn't in DOAJ. Why?

  Maybe the journal hasn't applied to us or its application is still in progress. Maybe the journal was [removed from DOAJ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183mRBRqs2jOyP0qZWXN8dUd02D4vL0Mov_kgYF8HORM/edit#gid=1650882189&range=A1).
