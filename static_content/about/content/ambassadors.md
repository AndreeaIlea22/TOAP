Since 2016 DOAJ has been proud to work with a group of Ambassadors who share our belief that open access is the way forward in scholarly publishing. Our Ambassador program focuses especially on areas of the world where greater awareness of the issues surrounding open access is needed, or where open access journals from the region are under-represented in DOAJ.

In 2016-17 DOAJ engaged 12 Ambassadors for the Global South as part of a project funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), covering Africa, Middle East, China and Latin America. We also extended this work by appointing Ambassadors in Russia.

Following the success of this project, we have continued working with Ambassadors in the Global South and Russia, and are excited to be working with additional Ambassadors in Indonesia (since September 2017), Korea (December 2017), North America (2020) and Japan (2020).
