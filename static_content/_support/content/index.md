Supporting DOAJ is the only way to ensure that we can continue to provide you and the academic community with this vital open access resource. We are very grateful to all our supporters in libraries, publishers and other organisations around the world.

You can support us:

+ with a one-time donation - see below.
+ with an annual contribution or a longer-term contribution, often over three years, having a greater impact on the future of DOAJ and allowing for more sustainable development.     ++ Libraries, consortia, all public organisations - see [Supporters page](/support/supporters/)
  ++ Publishers - see our [publisher supporters page](/support/publisher-supporter/)
+ via [sponsorship](/support/sponsors/)
