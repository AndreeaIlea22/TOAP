Over 80% of DOAJ funding comes from public organisations (libraries, library consortia, universities, research centres). We thank them! Without them, DOAJ would not be able to do what it does.

Many of them support DOAJ with an annual payment. A number of organisations commit to a "sustainable funding model" as originally recommended by [SCOSS](https://scoss.org/). Committing larger amounts of funding has a greater impact on DOAJâ€™s future and allows for more sustainable development.
