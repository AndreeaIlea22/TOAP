Supporting DOAJ is a way for publishers to show their commitment, not only to open access, but to a community-driven, non-profit, and diverse organisation.

To make it easier for publishers to choose the level of support that they are most comfortable with, we offer a variety of options. The list below shows suggested contributions based on business size, or publishers can offer any amount of their choosing. It is also possible to choose a discounted 3-year sustaining contribution, based on the rates below, or a single annual ammount.

For more information, [contact us](mailto:feedback@doaj.org) stating the name of your organisation.
