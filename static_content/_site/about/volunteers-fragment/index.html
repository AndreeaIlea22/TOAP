        <p>DOAJ would not be able to do the work that it does, at the capacity that it has, without the help of its volunteers. We are grateful for the hours that our volunteers contribute by reviewing new applications. With their consent, we have published their names below, as a way of thanks.
DOAJ volunteers come from all walks of life, from all over the globe. Every now and then we put out a call for more volunteers, often fluent in a specific language.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://blog.doaj.org/">our blog</a> or our <a href="http://twitter.com/doajplus">Twitter feed</a> to be alerted when the next call is published.</p>
