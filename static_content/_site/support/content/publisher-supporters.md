Supporting DOAJ is a way for publishers to show their commitment, not only to open access, but to a community-driven, non-profit, and diverse organisation.

To make it easier for publishers to choose the level of support that they are most comfortable with, we offer a variety of options. The list below shows suggested contributions based on business size, or publishers can offer any amount of their choosing. You can process your payment on the right.

It is also possible to choose a discounted 3-year sustaining contribution, based on the rates below, or a single annual ammount. For more information about that, [contact us](mailto:feedback@doaj.org) stating the name of your organisation.
