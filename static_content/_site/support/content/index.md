Support of DOAJ by academic organisations is vital and we are proud to acknowledge that over 80% of our support comes to us this way. We are very grateful to all our supporting academic organisations from around the world.

The suggested contributions for academic organisations are detailed below. Use the table to find the most appropriate option for your organisation. [Send an email](mailto:lars@doaj.org) to Lars Bj√∏rnshauge with the details of the support level you would like to provide. He will be happy to issue you with your invoice. Alternatively, you can use our invoice-free one-time donation button to send us an amount of your choosing.

For our larger publishing supporters, we have a series of suggested [contributor categories plus benefits](/support/sponsors/). For the smaller publishing organisations, our [publisher contributions](/support/publisher-supporters/) may be more suitable.

For those of you wishing to make a one-off donation, you can do that on this page too.
