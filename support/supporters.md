Some organisations support DOAJ with an annual payment.

Others commit larger amounts of funding, which has a greater impact on DOAJâ€™s future and allows for more sustainable development. Some committed to a funding model as recommended by [SCOSS](https://scoss.org/). (The funding initiative ran from 2018 to 2020.)
