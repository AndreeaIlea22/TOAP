<h2>Journal Application Form</h2>

<p><b>Before you start</b><br>
Read our <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishers') }}">information for publishers</a>, review your website and make sure
that your journal fulfills all the criteria.</p>

<p>DO NOT SUBMIT REAPPLICATIONS WITH THIS FORM. You must do that from <a href="https://doaj.org/publisher/progress">
    the Reapplications tab</a> in your account.</p>

<p>Guides to completing the form are also <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.translated') }}">available in other languages
(中文, فارسی, Polski, Português, Русский, Español, Türkçe, Українська)</a>.</p>

<p><b><i>DISCLAIMER</i></b><br>
<p>The applicant is responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application for consideration. 
If the information provided is not sufficient or is incomplete, the application will not be considered. In cases where 
the information provided is found to be untrue—either during reviewing or even after admission—we reserve the right to 
reject or remove the journal with immediate effect and to not accept new applications for a period of 1 year. In cases
where a single publisher has submitted more than 5 applications with false information, we reserve the right to remove 
all of the publisher's journals and to not accept any more applications for a maximum period of 3 years, depending on 
the number of journals for which false information was provided and the eventual number of repeated incidents.</p>
