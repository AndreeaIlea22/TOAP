Dear Publisher,

{{journal_name}}

Thank you for submitting your update request which has been safely received! You will receive an automated email from us when the update request is assigned to an editor and then another email when they start working on it. It may take up to 6 months before you get a decision from us but please be assured that we are working as hard as we can with the resources we have. In the meantime, your original journal record is still visible in DOAJ and you may continue to upload article metadata to us.

Please save this email as a record of when you submitted your update request. We will not reply to emails requesting a status update for requests which are less than 6 months old. Before you contact us requesting an update, please check your spam folder to ensure that a member of our editorial team has not already contacted you. They may not be emailing from a doaj.org email address.

Yours faithfully,

The DOAJ Editorial Team
