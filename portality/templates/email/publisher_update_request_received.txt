Thank you for submitting an update to your journal. This has been safely received. A Managing Editor will start to review it soon. In the meantime, your original journal record is still visible in DOAJ and you may continue to upload article metadata to us.

Please save this email as a record of when you submitted your update. We cannot give status updates for submissions which are less than 3 months old. Before you contact us requesting information on the status of an update, please check your Spam folder to ensure that a member of our editorial team (a volunteer who may not have a doaj.org email address) has not already contacted you.

Yours faithfully,
