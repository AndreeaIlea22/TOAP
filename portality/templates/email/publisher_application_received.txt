Thank you for your application which has been safely received! You will receive an automated email from us when the application
has been assigned to an editor and then another email when they start working on it. Due to the extra workload created
by the ongoing re-application project, it may take up to 6 months before you get a final decision from us. We apologise in advance
for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard as we can with the resources we have.

Please save this email as a record of when you submitted your application. We will not reply to emails requesting a status update for applications which are less than 6 months old. Before you contact us requesting an update, please check your spam folder to ensure that a member of our editorial team has not already contacted you. They may not be emailing from a doaj.org email address.

Yours faithfully,

The DOAJ Editorial Team
