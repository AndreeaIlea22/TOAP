<h2>Copyright & Licensing help</h2>
<p>If you are unsure how to answer the Copyright & Licensing section of the application form, use the resources on 
this page to help you.</p>
<p>In May 2015, DOAJ published two posts, on the <a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/">DOAJ News Service</a>, which delved into the incompatibilities that can 
exist between copyright and licensing, Creative Commons licensed in particular.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/copyright-and-licensing-incompatibility-part-1/">Part One</a>
  explains the differences between copyright and licensing. It provides longer explanations of what 
  Questions 45 to 50 are asking for. Read these definitions before answering the questions in the application.</li>
  <li><a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/copyright-and-licensing-part-2/">Part Two</a> studies, 
  in detail, the different contexts where incompatibilities between copyright and licensing occur. It illustrates each 
  scenario with real instances of copyright and licensing, taken from a variety of publishers. It also contains a reading
   list for those who wish to find out more.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about copyright and licensing, leave your question at the bottom of either of the two posts
 and we will be in touch!</p>
