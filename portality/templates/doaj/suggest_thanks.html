<h3>Application safely received</h3>
<p>Thank you for your re/application which has been safely received! You will receive an automated email from us when the re/application
has been assigned to an editor and then another email when they start working on it. Due to the extra workload created
by the ongoing re-application project, it may take up to 6 months before you get a final decision from us. We apologise in advance 
for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard as we can with the resources we have.</p>

<p>We will not reply to emails requesting a status update for re/applications that are less than 6 months old. Before you 
contact us requesting an update, please check your spam folder to ensure that a member of our editorial team has not already 
contacted you. They may not be emailing from a doaj.org email address.</p>
