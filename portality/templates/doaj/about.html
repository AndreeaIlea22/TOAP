<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals was launched in 2003 at Lund University, Sweden, with 300 open access journals
and today contains ca. 9000 open access journals covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, 
social science and humanities.</p>

<p>DOAJ is a membership organisation and membership is available in 3 main categories: 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishermembers') }}">Publisher</a>, <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.members') }}">Ordinary Member
</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.sponsors') }}">Sponsor</a>. A DOAJ Membership is a clear statement of intent and 
proves a commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access. DOAJ is co-author to the 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing
(Principles)</a> and DOAJ members are expected to follow these principles as a condition of membership. DOAJ reserves the 
right to reject applications for membership, or revoke membership if a member or sponsor is found to contravene the 
Principles. <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.support_doaj') }}">Read more about membership here</a>.</p>

<p>DOAJ is a community-curated list of open access journals and aims to be the starting point for all information searches for 
quality, peer reviewed open access material. To assist libraries and indexers keep their lists up-to-date, we make 
public a list of journals that have been <a href="http://bit.ly/1IOA9AJ">accepted into or removed from</a> DOAJ but we 
will not discuss specific details of an application with anyone apart from the applicant. Neither will we discuss individual
publishers or applications with members of the public unless we believe that, by doing so, we will be making a positive
contribution to the open access community.</p>

<p>DOAJ publishes <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishers') }}">Information for Publishers</a> on this site to help
Publishers adhere to the Principles and to assist them in completing 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.suggestion') }}">an application</a>. DOAJ also publishes 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.faq') }}">a list of FAQs</a> relevant to all members of the publishing community, 
particularly libraries and authors. All information on this site is available to both members and non-members.</p>

<h3><a name="aimscope"></a>Aims & Scope</h3>

<p>The aim of the DOAJ is to increase the visibility and ease of use of open access scientific and scholarly journals, 
thereby promoting their increased usage and impact. The DOAJ aims to be comprehensive and cover all open access 
scientific and scholarly journals that use a quality control system to guarantee the content. In short, the DOAJ aims 
to be the one-stop shop for users of open access journals.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name="constitution"></a>Constitution</h3>

<p>DOAJ is a not-for-profit organisation managed by <a href="http://is4oa.org/">Infrastructure Services for Open Access
C.I.C.</a> (Community Interest Company) based in the United Kingdom. DOAJ relies entirely on the voluntary donations 
of its members and on sponsorship monies received.  In March 2016, DOAJ received

for a specific timed project tackling the improvement of open access journals in the Global South. Neither DOAJ or IS4OA receives grants or 
funding from any other source.</p>
