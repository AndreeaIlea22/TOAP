<h3>Become a Publisher Member</h3> 
<p>
<b>Support DOAJ and make a financial contribution</b>
<br>
DOAJ relies entirely on donations from the community. We urge you to become a 
<a href="/support">Publisher Member</a>. Members receive a quarterly newsletter and may carry the DOAJ 
logo on their site.
<br><br>

<h3>Uploading metadata to DOAJ</h3>
<p>DOAJ is under development. Until further notice, publishers will only able to upload article metadata to us, 
using an XML file. Temporarily, publishers are no longer able to submit metadata to us on an article-by-article 
basis. The XML upload no longer requires a login but publishers will be asked to provide their username* so we 
can match your upload to your journal.</p>

<p>Until further notice, the xml uploaded to us will be held in a repository and will NOT be published to the live 
site. This is necessary while we carry out the development work.</p>

<p>We thank you for your patience while we make essential changes to our site. We are working toward a more useful 
DOAJ with an improved user interface. If you have any questions, or you require the URL for the XML upload, please 
  use the Contact Us link at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h3>Good practice guidelines for Open Access publishers</h3> 

<p><b>One URL for each journal, one PDF for each article</b></p>
<p>When a journal gets indexed it will have its own record in the directory.</p>

<p>To make our service comprehensible and user-friendly, the link from the directory must go to the URL for the specific journal and not to a collection of journals.</p>

<p>Please note that all necessary information (by 'necessary information', we are referring to the journal's aims and scope, the clear presence of the editorial board, the author guidelines, the description of the quality control system and the Open Access statement) about the specific journal should be available at its own URL to make it easier for users to interpret the information correctly.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that your content is available article by article, one PDF for each article, and not one PDF per issue. This has multiple advantages, such as direct linking to articles, promotes findability, easier to navigate, read and download.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>Knowledge organization, commercials and ads</b></p>

<p>Please pay attention to the fact that having a clear structure when organizing your material makes it easier for users to navigate between articles.</p>

<p>Preferably articles will be gathered in volumes, marked with the year the articles were published, making it easier for scholars to cite them (and readers to find them).</p>

<p>If publishing different types of articles (for example original articles, review articles, case studies, essays or book reviews) please note that it is advantageous to display articles of the same type together in each volume and to mark each article with the specific article type.</p>

<p>If you find it necessary to have commercials or banner advertising on your journal's web site(s), make sure that the ad is not in any way offensive and doesn't include information that could decrease the credibility of your journal.</p>

<p>Blinking and/or moving objects will distract a reader and make your web site difficult to "read". This is discouraged.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, in the long run, articles that are not clearly organised and/or too many commercials/ads/blinking or moving objects will decrease the usage of your web site.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>Transparent editorial boards</b>

<p>We believe that it increases the trustworthiness and credibility of a journal if the reader is able to find/contact the editor or members of the editorial board. For this reason we encourage you to be as transparent as possible when presenting your Editorial Board. Information of public interest is:

<ul>
  <li>The affiliation of the editorial board members;</li>
  <li>The contact addresses of the editorial board members;</li>
  <li>If possible, we recommend you to add a link to the web site where the specific editorial board member is presented by his or her employing institution.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>Quality control and author guidelines</b></p>

<p>To assure readers and potential authors that articles go through a quality control system before publication, we strongly recommend that you describe the process clearly on the web site.</p>

<p>Since Open Access is still a relatively young way of publishing research papers and scholarly materials, we believe that it is important to show that open access journals have the same, rigorous quality control systems as printed and subscription based journals.</p>

<p>Having detailed and comprehensive guidelines for authors is a good way of helping potential contributors and saves you time since it can prevent a lot of unnecessary paperwork and manuscript resubmissions.</p>

<p>We recommend all journals have author guidelines (Instructions for authors) and that the following are included:

<ul>
  <li>A detailed style guide;</li>
  <li>A description of the quality control processes;</li>
  <li>If the journal charges authors or authors' institutions any handling fees, publication fees or similar, the amount should be clearly stated;</li>
  <li>Information about copyright (please note the importance of informing authors about whether the journal will be the copyright holder after publication of an article or if the copyright remains with the author(s). We strongly believe that authors should be informed about your copyright/licensing conditions before they submit their work);</li>
  <li>Description of how to submit an article;</li>
  <li>A contact email address.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>Statement about Open Access and copyright</b></p>

<p>Since DOAJ is a collection of Open Access journals and articles, we strongly recommend that you not only mention but thoroughly describe the journal's Open Access policy on the web site. It should be clearly linked to from the home page.</p>

<p>Clearly stating exactly which rights readers have when they use the material is a way of showing that you are sharing your published material to support a greater global exchange of knowledge. It is also a way of protecting your material from illegal use (for example if you are stating that you prohibit reproduction or commercial use of your articles).</p>

<p>Here is an example of an Open Access statement, fitting our criteria, that could be published on your website:</p>

<blockquote>This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</blockquote>

<p>Please take care to identify any possible contradictions between your Open Access policy and your copyright policy.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>Licensing your material with a CC-license</b></p>

<p>An additional way of showing in which form a journal is Open Access is through licensing it with a Creative Commons license. (Read more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">the different forms of licenses</a>.)</p>

<p>Such licensing is very beneficial for authors since it shows, for example, if there are any limits in creating derivative works.</p>

<p>If licensing old material, please make sure that your journal has the copyright permission of the published material. If you do not, you have to ask the original copyright holder for permission before licensing the articles. (More information can be found at the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">Creative Commons web site</a>.)</p>
