<h2>Volunteering for DOAJ</h2>
<p>DOAJ would not be able to do the work that it does without the help of its volunteers. We are grateful for the hours 
that all our volunteers contribute by reviewing new applications and reapplications.</p>

<p>To coincide with Open Access Week 2015, DOAJ is launching a volunteer loyalty program. A certificate, signed by the 
Editor-in-Chief and the Managing Director, will be awarded to all volunteers for every 50 records (applications or reapplications)
reviewed. A new certificate will be awarded for every 50 records thereafter. At 100 records, the volunteer gets a DOAJ 
email address.</p>

<p>We're also exploring the option of awarding <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Open Badges</a> so that a DOAJ 
volunteer can officially declare their work. We are considering hosting an annual virtual volunteer meeting to bring our 
volunteers together and give them the opportunity to network, exchange ideas or ask questions. Watch this space!</p>

<p>Finally, the names of all our active and working volunteers will be listed on this page.</p>

<p>For more information on how to volunteer, please take a look at <a href="http://bit.ly/1Jb3TKi">our volunteer 
announcement</a> and then, if you are interested in becoming a reviewer, <a href="http://bit.ly/1CJuJYG">apply here.</a></p>

<h3>Our Volunteers</h3>
<p>Our thanks goes to the following people who are actively working for DOAJ and who are making an active contribution to
the quality and reputation of open access:</p>
