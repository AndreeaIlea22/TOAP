<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION FAQS -->

<h3><b><a name="whatis"></a>What is DOAJ?</b></h3> 
<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals is a service that indexes and provides access to quality, peer reviewed Open
Access research journals, periodicals and their articles' metadata. The Directory aims to be comprehensive and cover 
all open access scientific and scholarly journals that use an appropriate "quality control" system and is not limited
to particular languages or subject areas. The Directory aims to increase the visibility and ease of use of open access 
scientific and scholarly journals—regardless of size and country of origin—thereby promoting their visibility, usage 
and impact.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="definition"></a>How do we define 'Open Access Journal', 'Quality Control', 'Research Journal', 
'Periodical'?</b></h3> 

<p><b>Open Access Journal:</b><br>
We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions
for access. From the BOAI definition<sup>[1]</sup> of open access we take the right of users to <b>"read, download, 
copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles"</b> as mandatory for a journal to be 
included in the directory.<br>
[1] <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read</a>
  
</p> 

<p><b>Quality Control:</b><br>
<p>The journal must exercise some form of peer review or editorial quality control to be included.</p>

<p><b>Research Journal:</b><br>
<p>Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a scholarly community.</p>

<p><b>Periodical:</b><br>
<p>A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular intervals, generally more frequently than annually,
each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories, or other 
writings.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="standards"></a>What are the basic standards that a journal must meet for the application to be 
considered?</b></h3>

<p>A journal must meet the following basic standards for an application to be considered. Meeting these standards 
does <b>not</b> guarantee a successful application.</p>

<p><b>Coverage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Subject: all scientific and scholarly subjects are covered. We use the 
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/">Library of Congress Classification Outline</a>.</li>
<li>Types of resource: scientific and scholarly periodicals that publish research or review papers in full text.</li>
<li>Acceptable sources: academic, government, commercial, non-profit and private sources are all acceptable.</li> 
<li>Level: the primary target group should be researchers.</li> 
<li>Content: a substantive part of the journal should consist of research papers. All content should be available in 
full text.</li>
<li>All languages.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Access:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The full text of all content must be available for free and is Open Access without delay (i.e. no embargo period).</li> 
<li>Registration: User registration online is acceptable on the condition that the journal has a proper Privacy Policy 
in place and abides by global Data Protection rules. That is to say: user data will never be distributed without the 
explicit permission of the user; upon request, a user's email address is removed from mailing lists; all data held about
the user will be made available to the user upon request.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quality:</b> The journal must exercise quality control on submitted papers through an editor, editorial board and
  a peer-review system.</p>

<p><b>Periodical:</b> The journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registered at 
<a href="http://www.issn.org">issn.org</a>. In general, if a journal exists in print and online, then it should have an
ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="procedure"></a>What is the procedure for a journal being accepted into DOAJ?</b></h3>

<p><b>Application</b></p>
<p>We must receive an application for every journal wishing to be considered for inclusion. Due to the level of detail
required, we recommend that the application is made by the journal's editor or publisher. There are over 40 pieces of 
information that we will check for every application. The key point to remember when completing the application is that
the web site states clearly and accurately the information required in the application. Here is an example of some of 
the things that we will check:
<ul>
<li>That the journal's ISSN(s) number(s) is registered at issn.org and matches the application;</li> 
<li>That the title in the application matches what that registered at issn.org;</li>
<li>That the country of the publisher in the application matches that registered at issn.org; this may not always be 
the country to which the journal is registered.</li>
<li>That the journal has an editorial board with identifiable members; we will ask for members' contact details as 
part of the application review process. These will not be made publicly available.</li>
<li>That the full text of articles is free, without embargo, and immediately available upon publication;</li>
<li>That the journal's Open Access policy is clearly stated and easily findable on the web site;</li> 
<li>That the journal executes some form of peer review, that it is clearly stated on the web site and it matches that 
which is stated in the application form;</li>
<li>That the journal is Open Access according to the BOAI definition. By this we mean that the journal's articles have 
"free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, 
or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for
any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining 
access to the internet itself."</li>
<li>That if the journal has article processing charges (APCs), they are clearly stated and easily findable on the web 
site;</li>
<li>That if the journal has any other kind of author charges, they are clearly stated and easily findable on the web 
site;</li>
<li>That the language of the full text articles match the language stated in the application.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Other information requested in the application will also be checked. If the information provided in the
application is unclear or does not match what is on the site, or we think that it is incorrect, a member of our team 
will contact the person listed in Question 9.  We will also look for examples of Best Practice.</p>

<p><b>Status updates</b><br>
<p>We will not provide status updates for any application that is less than THREE months old.</p>

<p><b>Acceptance into DOAJ</b><br>
<p>Upon acceptance into DOAJ, the journal is classified by the DOAJ team according to the Library of Congress 
Classification (LCC) system. An automatic confirmation email is sent to the person listed in Question 9; it contains 
details on how to log into your Publisher account. You will need these details to upload article metadata. The journal 
is visible in DOAJ immediately.</p>

<p><b>Rejection of an Application</b></br>
<p>If your application is rejected, a member of the DOAJ team will let you know with the reason for rejection. A 
journal may reapply for inclusion more than once but no more than one application may be received at any one time. If 
you make multiple applications, only the most recent one will be considered; all others will be deleted.</p> 

<p><b>Uploading or creating metadata in DOAJ</b><br>
<p>We <b><i>strongly</i></b> recommend that ALL journals provide us with <a href="/publisher/uploadfile">article 
metadata in XML format</a> or create the data manually using <a href="/publisher/metadata">our metadata entry form</a>. 
A script looking for new articles to publish to the site runs every 30 minutes. DOAJ is <a href="#oai">OAI-PMH</a> 
compliant and once the article is available in DOAJ it becomes automatically OAI harvestable.</p>

<!--
<h3><b><a name="seal">What is the DOAJ Seal of Approval for Open Access Journals (the DOAJ Seal)</a></b></h3> 
<p>A Seal to Set Standards for Open Access Journals.</p>
<p>DOAJ has introduced a certification scheme for Open Access journals, the 'DOAJ Seal'.</p>
<p>To receive the Seal, the journal must comply with all of the criteria in the last section of the Application form:
<ul>
<li>The journal uses DOIs as permanent identifiers;</li>
<li>Provide DOAJ with article metadata;</li>
<li>A long term digital preservation or archiving program;</li>
<li>Embedded machine-readable CC licensing information in articles;</li>
<li>Allows generous reuse and mixing of content, in accordance with a CC BY license;</li>
<li>Has a deposit policy registered wíth a deposit policy registry, like Sherpa/Romeo.</li>

<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="journallicense"></a>How is license information applied and displayed in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>The current version of DOAJ allows publishers to supply license information at the JOURNAL level. 
Because some journals have different licenses from one article to another, we ask publishers to supply the license 
that best fits ALL of the content; this is usually the most restrictive license. We are working to give greater 
granularity to license information.</p>

<h3><b><a name="thetick"></a>What does the green tick symbol mean?</b></h3>
<p>In March 2014, DOAJ started to implemented its new criteria for journals being accepted into the directory. All 
journals accepted after this date display a green tick symbol:</br>
<img src='/static/doaj/images/tick_short.png' title='Accepted after March 2014' 
alt='Tick icon: journal was accepted after March 2014'> appears next to the journal title in search results;</br>

<h3><b><a name="java"></a>Can I use DOAJ with Javascript disabled?</b></h3>
<p>If you disable all Javascript, it will not be possible to search the DOAJ. If you can switch off certain components 
and allow others, then you can continue to use DOAJ. Search will not work with Javascript switched off completely because
some of the code that is required is served by Google's Javascript library hosting so if disallowed, search will fail. 
Other Javascript components are 'Addthis' which is our share feature that allows people to share items from within our
site. Disabling this will simply disable the feature. Another component is Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) which is the 
framework used to build the DOAJ website. This contains some Javascript for some of its features. Bootstrap was 
originally created by Twitter and made publicly available. We're not aware of any data collected by Twitter as part of 
its integration into the DOAJ site.</p>

<h3><b><a name="browse"></a>What happened to Browse? How can I browse journals by Subject?</b></h3> 
<p>The updated Search functionality in DOAJ combines the traditional functions of search and browse into one.
This is an updated way of finding information, in line with the process of filtering and drilling down to the results
that are required.</p>

<p>To browse for journals by subject:<br></p>

<ul>Starting at the <a href="/search">Search page</a>:
  <li>Select 'journal' from the 'Journals vs Articles' facet</li>
  <li>From under the 'Subject' facet, choose the subject that you wish to browse</li>
  <li>To see more Subjects than the 10 listed, change the number at the top of the facet from '10' to the number of 
  Subjects you would like to see.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>Only journals corresponding to the chosen subject will show. You may make further refinements by selecting other 
  facets.</p>
<p>We will be adding a Subject browser to the site at some point in the near future.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>


<h3><b><a name="byCountry"></a>Can I find information about which countries have journals included in DOAJ?</b></h3> 
<p>Yes, go to the <a ref="/search">Advanced Search page</a> and select 'journal' from the 'Journals vs. Articles' facet 
at the top of the left hand panel. Then expand the 'Country of publisher/publication' facet to show all journals 
published by country. By default the list is sorted by country with the most journals, in descending order.To see more 
than 10 countries, change the number at the top of the facet from '10' to a greater number.</p>

<h3><b><a name="fees"></a>How can I find out whether a journal charges author processing fees (APCs)?</b></h3>
<p>You can find this information in two ways:
<ul>
  <li>Go to the Advanced Search page and expand the 'Publication charges' facet. By selecting 'No charges', you will 
  retrieve a list of all the journals in DOAJ where the publisher has told us that they do not charge authors anything 
  at all.</li>

(<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH</a>). Thus, any OAI compatible service
can obtain records from DOAJ. The OAI data is always up to date. OAI is well-established and easy to use. The base URL 
is: http://www.doaj.org/oai. You can add most OAI verbs and other commands directly on to that. <a href="/features">
Read a full description of this service here</a>. Our current OAI offering is standardised around Dublin Core. We will 
expanding the metadata in it in the latter half of 2014.</p> 

<a name="metadata_csv"></a>
<p>You can also <b>Download a list of journals in CSV (comma-separated) format</b> which can then be 
imported into Excel or any equivalent analysis tool. The CSV file is updated every 30 minutes. To retrieve the data:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/csv">Download the file to your computer</a></li>
<li>Open the file in a document processing program like Excel or OpenOffice.</li>

credentials will be the same; the new journal will have been added to the existing account.</p>

<p>If a new account has been created, an email is sent to the contact in Question 9 of the application. The email 
contains your username and a link you click to choose a password. The link is valid for 14 days only. Once you have 
logged in to your account, you will see your journal(s) listed.</p>

<p>If you have problems logging in, or you cannot see your journal listed, or you would like to merge two publisher 
accounts, then please <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>.

<h3><b><a name="publisher"></a>How do I upload article metadata to DOAJ?</b></h3> 
<p>Once a journal has been accepted in to DOAJ, article metadata may be uploaded as XML or created manually. If the
journal belongs to an existing DOAJ account, then the publisher must <a href="http://doaj.org/account/login">log in to 
their account</a> and then add metadata via the <a href="http://doaj.org/publisher/">Publisher Area</a>. For more 
information go to the <a href="/publishers">For publishers</a> page and read the 'Uploading Metadata' section there.

<h3><b><a name="update"></a>I have uploaded article metadata to DOAJ but it has not appeared on the site. Has something 
gone wrong?</b></h3>
<p>If you did not receive any error messages when you uploaded the metadata then it is unlikely that anything
  has gone wrong with the upload process. However, it is possible that the article you are looking for has been 
  overwritten by another one. <b>The URL for every article provided must be unique.</b> We use the full text URL to 
  match two versions of the same article. If you have provided the same URL for every article then only the last 
  article uploaded will appear on the site.</p>
  
<p>Articles appear on the site within 60 minutes of a successful upload. After 60 minutes, the fastest way to check 
that your article is on the site is to search on the FULL ARTICLE TITLE with " " around it. e.g. "Is social, cultural 
and recreational participation a luxury for people living in poverty? An analysis of policy intentions and measures".
</p>

<p>Articles are added to a journal's Tables of Contents over night so you will not see them there immediately.</p>

<p>If, after 24 hours, you still cannot find your article on the site, please <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><b><a name="getlicense"></a>How do I get a Creative Commons license on to my content?</b></h3> 

<p>You may have an equivalent license in your country that is not a CC license. This is perfectly valid for DOAJ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the most appropriate CC license from the Creative Commons web site—refer to the paragraph below.</li>
<li>We recommend that you apply the CC BY license which is the most user friendly allowing for, among other things, 
long-term preservation and text- and data-mining.</li>
<li>If you have different licenses for different articles, only the most restrictive can be displayed against your 
journal entry in DOAJ.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to choose the CC BY license:</p>
<p>Go to the Creative Commons (CC) web site <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)</a> and copy the CC BY Icon - you can also consult this:
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing .</a>
</p>
<p>Put the CC BY icon on the homepage of your journal(s) and on EVERY article.
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">Read how</a>. Best Practice is that the
license metadata is machine readable that is to say: embedded in the HTML, XML or in the PDF metadata.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>


<h3><b><a name="license"></a>How do I know which CC license to choose?</b></h3> 
<p>You can find information on the different types of licenses at the Creative Commons web site: 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/</a> and there is even a page 
to help you choose the correct license for your content: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">
http://creativecommons.org/choose/</a>.</p>

<p>Both pages are available in 24 different languages.</p>

<h3><b><a name="embed"></a>How do I know if my license information is embedded in the metadata?</b></h3> 
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, one of the questions asks whether or not you have 
machine-readable licensing information embedded in your article metadata. There are 
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">guidelines on the Creative Commons</a> web site that tell you more about 
this. The information is must be embedded in the HTML, the XML or the PDFs. The emphasis for DOAJ is not HOW the 
license is embedded but that there is a <b>machine-readable</b> version of it. Here are a couple of examples:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23456">Displayed in the HTML on an article
abstract page</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097648;jsessionid=38F0E3B4732EA026B15F2CF0AC9CB791">

<h3><b><a name="casereport"></a>Do case reports count as original articles?</b></h3> 
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, you should include case reports in your article count if they 
include the retrospective analysis of more than 3 clinical cases.  When more than three cases are involved, the 
article constitutes "research."</p>

<h3><b><a name="deposit"></a>We have no deposit restrictions on articles published in our journal. Why does the 
Application Form ask for information about deposit policies?</b></h3> 
<p>Funders, libraries and authors can all access deposit policy directories to get an overview of publishing 
channels that are compliant with, for instance, funder policies. This is one of our areas where we are encouraging
Best Practice. A good example of a deposit policy directory is 
<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/</a>.</p>
