<h3>Deleting articles from DOAJ</h3>
<p>If an article or a range of articles needs to be deleted, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">Contact Us</a>. 
Please email us ALL of the following information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Name of the journal, as it appears in DOAJ</li>
  <li>The URL of the journal in DOAJ ( which will look something like 
  http://doaj.org/toc/1234-5678 )</li>
  <li>The title of EVERY article to be deleted. If an article appears twice, include details of what is wrong 
  so we know which one to delete.</li>
  <li>If you are asking us to delete a large range of content, there is no need to send the title of every article but 
  you must include the volume and issue range. For example, Volume 1, Issue 1, Jan 2010 to Volume 2, Issue 4, Dec 
  2011.</li>
  <li>Send a screenshot if it will help.</li>
