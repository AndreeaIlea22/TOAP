<h1>Help for publishers</h1>

<h2>Uploading metadata/article content a file</h2>

  <p>There are three ways to upload article metadata to DOAJ:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('doaj.docs') }}">API</a> (you will need an API key to do this),</li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}">uploading XML</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('publisher.metadata') }}">entering the metadata manually</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are instructions on how to prepare and upload your XML file on our <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.xml') }}">XML documentation page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="explanations">Failed XML uploads explained</h2>

<p>This section explains the error messages that you may see when you upload article XML to DOAJ. Depending on the message in the 'Notes' column of your <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}"><em>History of uploads</em></a> table, you may be able to correct your XML.</p>

<p>If you cannot correct the XML successfully, please <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a bug report</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The time of the file upload</li>
  <li>Whether you are uploading DOAJ or Crossref XML</li>
  <li>Whether you are uploading a file or uploading from a link</li>
  <li>The exact error message as it appears in the “Notes” column, including the text in the 'What does this mean?' section</li>
  <li>A screenshot of the error messsage</li>
  <li>Your publisher account ID or the account ID you are logged in with</li>
  <li>The file(s) you had problems with</li>
</ul>

        Check that the file really is valid XML.<br/>
        <br/>
        In some cases, you may have uploaded/given the wrong file, so double-check that it is the correct one. You could get this error, for example, if you have uploaded a Word document or a PDF by mistake.<br/>
        <br/>
        In other cases, files can look like XML, but still be invalid. They should be run through an XML validator to ensure they have the correct structure and that there are no invalid characters.<br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes, special characters &ndash; especially those in scientific articles &ndash; are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters as-is but those that are can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found on Wikipedia</a>.

      </td>
      <td>
        Check that the file conforms to the DOAJ schema, using a validator.<br/>
        <br/>
        Often the problem arises because the XML is missing a required tag. The schema validation will fail if you try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a specific tag. You can see exactly <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.xml') }}">which tags are required here</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you are trying to upload a file that was automatically generated by the OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should first contact OJS for help.<br/>
        <br/>
        The DOAJ schema is on our site, here: <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a><br/>
        <br/>
        To validate the provided XML against the schema, you can use one of these services:<br/>
        <br/>
        <em><a href="http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation">W3C Validator</a>
        <br/>
        </em> <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">freeformatter.com</a>: don’t forget to insert the contents of the schema (XSD) into the bottom box or provide a URL to either of them (you can use the URL <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a> for the DOAJ schema).<br/>
        <br/>
        If both of these services determine the provided XML to be schema-valid, please <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a bug report</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.

        The article belongs to a journal that does not belong to your user account<br/>
        <br/>
        You can only upload XML for the journals that are <strong>in DOAJ</strong> and that appear in the list under <em>Your journals</em> in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge them, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        The article’s stated ISSNs must match to a journal that is owned by the user account from which you are providing the XML file. If the ISSNs do not match any journals or match a journal that is owned by a different account, the import of that article will fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        Note that it is also possible that if an article has more than one ISSN (i.e. an E-ISSN and a P-ISSN), that those ISSNs could match more than one Journal (one ISSN matching one journal, the other ISSN matching another). If both matched journals are owned by your account, this will not stop the article from being imported, but if one of the matched journals is owned by a different account this will cause the import of the article to fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version. Sometimes the ISSNs of the journal have changed.
        <br/>
        The print and online ISSNs you have supplied are identical. If you supply 2 ISSNs they must be different: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.

      <td>
        Check that all the Article ISSNs in the file are correct<br/>
        <br/>
        If you need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> and we will check that the ISSNs are registered at <a href="https://portal.issn.org/">the ISSN Portal</a> and will then update the record accordingly.<br/>

<h2 id="preservation">Preserve articles</h2>

<p>Articles can be preserved via DOAJ if your journal has been pre-approved to use this feature and you see the 'Preservation' tab on your Publisher Dashboard.</p>

<p>You must do the following to get your journal's content preserved:
  <ol>
    <li>You collect the content into a package consisting of folders and files</li>
    <li>You zip the package</li>
    <li>You <a href="/publisher/preservation">upload the zipped package</a></li>
    <li>Check that the file uploaded correctly in the 'History of Uploads' section</li>
    <li>Max upload size supported is 50Mb</li>
  </ol>

<p>The package must have the following structure:</br>
    <code>
      \-journal directory</br>
        &nbsp;\-article1 directory</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;\-article</br>
        &nbsp;\-article2 directory</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;\-article</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;\-identifier.txt</br>
        &nbsp;\-identifiers.csv</br>
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>Each package must contain a list of the articles' identifiers. The file can be a .txt file (identifiers.txt) or a .csv. (identifiers.csv). The identifier can be the URL of the full text of the article, or the article's DOI. Here is [help on how to create the identifiers file plus an example file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eu9LJhMtrFIPKZoyXMY3tLKGDnhwb9AAdwNu9pqlxvw/edit?usp=sharing). identifier.txt file is located under article directory. identifiers.csv file is located under journal directory. This file may contain all articles identifiers. More than one identifier (both URL and DOI) can be mentioned for a article.</p>
  
<p>Create a zip file of the package and upload it to us on the Preservation tab. Feedback about whether the upload has been successful or not is provided at the bottom of that page. </p>

<p>After the content has been uploaded successfully, you will only notified with status message 'successfully processed'  </p>
