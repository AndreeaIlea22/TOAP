*All the details about DOAJ's 20th anniversary celebrations can be accessed from this page.*

This page will be updated throughout the year.

We are running a year-long campaign and will be holding three events around the themes: 'Open', 'Global', and 'Trusted'. Details will be available on this page. We will also be interviewing key individuals from DOAJ's history, and DOAJ's historical timeline from 2003 to today. 

If you'd like to be get details about all the DOAJ@20 activities, please [register with us](https://forms.reform.app/S49aj6/DOAJat20/257xim).
