*All the details about DOAJ's 20th-anniversary celebrations can be accessed from this page, which will be updated throughout the year.*

We are celebrating 20 years of being an important part of open infrastructure with a year-long campaign throughout 2023, and we want to invite you to be a part of our celebrations!

We are holding three events for our community around the themes: 'Open', 'Global', and 'Trusted'. Details about these events and how you can join them will be available on this page. We will also share interviews with key individuals who have shaped DOAJ into what it is today.

This page also includes a historical timeline to give you a full overview of DOAJ’s important milestones from 2003 to today.

## Timeline 

{.timeline .tabular-list}
- ### 12th May 2003
   - #### Some subheading
   - The [Budapest Open Access Initiative](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) has been published and at the 2002 [Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication](https://content.iospress.com/articles/information-services-and-use/isu368), Lund, Sweden, the idea of a directory of pure open access journals is born. Since Lund University Libray is hosting the conference, Lars Bjørnshauge, the Head Librarian and future Founder of DOAJ, suggests that Lund takes this task on. On 12th May 2003, DOAJ launches with [around 300 titles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loav8PNASmpx--eZrUc9IbWr11zOgFOXVZkvGnT4vNg/edit?usp=sharing) from a list generated by [Bo-Christer Björk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-christer-bj%C3%B6rk-20ba4827/).
     - ‘Moreover, some of the projects and the institutional repositories that universities have established have sidestepped the established mechanisms that give order and structure to the published literature. **There is no catalogue of open access journals.** They do not have ISSNs, and are not … indexed in the relevant abstracting and indexing services. They do not use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or CrossRef, the system of links from citations to full text. However worthwhile they may be, **if they are not integrated into the existing scholarly literature environment, they will not be found**.’
     - — ‘The First Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication’. Information Services & Use 1 Jan. 2002 : 191 – 194. [https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-2002-22407](https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-2002-22407)
- ### December 2012
   - #### Some subheading
   - IS4OA, DOAJ’s new parent company announces a new path of improvement and development for DOAJ, including plans to extend and make more rigorous DOAJ’s criteria. This is due to a surge in questionable publishers.
- ### March-May 2014
   - #### Some subheading
   - The DOAJ Team is struggling to keep up with the increasing number of applications, particularly due to a surge in low quality applications. Furthermore, there are calls of concern from the research and library communities about unserious players in the open access publishing industry and a lack of transparency. DOAJ knows it must keep these “predatory” journals out of the index and assure the community that peer-reviewed open access journals are trustworthy. In March, DOAJ launches a new extended set of criteria and a new application form, designed to keep questionable publishers and journals out. In May, DOAJ announces that 99.3% of the ~10,000 journals indexed will need to reapply under the new criteria if they wish to remain indexed in DOAJ. At the same time, it [publishes a list of journals that are added and removed](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/05/22/doaj-publishes-lists-of-journals-removed-and-added/) from DOAJ.
- ### July 2014
   - #### Some subheading
   - In January 2014, DOAJ put out a call to its communities for help in processing applications. While crowdsourcing was definitely very “in” at the time, using your user community within a scholarly communications context perhaps wasn’t so usual. [Crowdsourcing librarian power](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/06/09/crowdsourcing-librarian-power/) was a new approach to help cope with the increasing number of applications being submitted. Thankfully, DOAJ users are loyal and dedicated and so DOAJ [launched its volunteer network](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/07/01/doaj-editor-and-associate-editor-network-goes-live/) on 1st July of the same year with three teams: Chinese, English, and Spanish.
- ### June 2016
   - #### Some subheading
   - With a grant from the IDRC, DOAJ launches its Ambassador program and [introduces its new Ambassadors to the world](https://blog.doaj.org/2016/06/20/presenting-the-doaj-ambassadors/). Over time, this proves to be one of DOAJ’s most valuable and successful initiatives and today, it is a model that is copied by many other organisations in the industry.
- ### December 2017
   - #### Some subheading
   - After three years of hard work, DOAJ announces that its reapplication project is finally complete and the last reapplication has been processed. The Editorial Team has rejected reapplications from 2058 journals and then removed a further 2860 journals that never submitted a reapplication. Heavy losses are seen among journals from Japan, Pakistan, Canada, United States and Mexico. 
- ### 2019 to present day
   - #### Some subheading
   - Open access is growing. More and more, conversations are happening around open becoming the default and initiatives are developing to make this happen. DOAJ becomes a central pin in the growing open access movement thanks to its transparency, reliability and the degree of trust the community places in it. It is included in Plan S’ roadmap and as a key data source in their JCT tool. Attention starts to turn toward Diamond OA publishing, a flavour of journal that DOAJ has always supported. DOAJ launches [Project JASPER](https://doaj.org/preservation/) to help preserve the most vulnerable journals.
- ### 12th May 2023

   - Happy 20th birthday, DOAJ!
