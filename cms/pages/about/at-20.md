*All the details about DOAJ's 20th-anniversary celebrations can be accessed from this page.*

This page will be updated throughout the year.

We are running a year-long campaign and will hold three events around the themes: 'Open', 'Global', and 'Trusted'. Details will be available on this page. We will also interview key individuals who have shaped DOAJ into what it is today, and we will publish a historical timeline.

If you'd like to receive details about all the DOAJ@20 activities, please [register with us](https://forms.reform.app/S49aj6/DOAJat20/257xim).

You can also follow on social media with #DOAJat20.
