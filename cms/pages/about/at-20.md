*All the details about DOAJ's 20th-anniversary celebrations can be accessed from this page, which will be updated throughout the year.*

We are celebrating 20 years of being an important part of open infrastructure with a year-long campaign throughout 2023, and we want to invite you to be a part of our celebrations!

We are holding three events for our community around the themes: 'Open', 'Global', and 'Trusted'. Details about these events and how you can join them will be available on this page. We will also share interviews with key individuals who have shaped DOAJ into what it is today.

This page will also include a historical timeline to give you a full overview of DOAJâ€™s important milestones from 2003 to today.

Please [register with us](https://forms.reform.app/S49aj6/DOAJat20/257xim) if you'd like to receive details about all the DOAJat20 activities throughout the year.

Follow and join our celebration on social media: #DOAJat20 .

We look forward to seeing you!
