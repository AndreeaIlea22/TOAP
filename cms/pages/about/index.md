DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) was launched in 2003 with 300 open access journals. Today, this [independent](https://blog.doaj.org/2018/11/07/doaj-independence-and-the-importance-of-impartiality/) index contains almost [17 500 peer-reviewed, open access journals](/search/journals) covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, social sciences, arts and humanities. Open access journals from all countries and in all languages are accepted for indexing.

DOAJ is financially supported by many libraries, publishers and other like-minded organisations. Supporting DOAJ demonstrates a firm commitment to open access and the infrastructure that supports it.

DOAJ is a co-author to the [Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](/apply/transparency) that provide the basis of the [DOAJ basic criteria](/apply/guide) for inclusion.

## Our mission

DOAJ's mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. 

DOAJ will work with editors, publishers and journal owners to help them understand the value of best practice publishing and standards and to apply those to their own operations. 

DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining its primary services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.

## Constitution

DOAJ is an independent, non-profit organisation managed by [Infrastructure Services for Open Access C.I.C.](https://is4oa.org/) (IS4OA), a  [community interest company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) registered in the United Kingdom and with a branch in Denmark. 

DOAJ relies entirely on the voluntary donations of its supporters. Neither DOAJ or IS4OA receive grants or funding from any other source.

DOAJ has an [Advisory Board and Council](/about/advisory-board-council), the members of which carry out their duties voluntarily.

The work done by the [DOAJ Team](/about/team/) is supported by over 100 voluntary editorial staff who help us to review applications. All volunteers are bound by an agreement and must declare any conflicts of interest.

DOAJ also has a global network of Ambassadors who promote open access and best practice in their regions. Our Ambassadors are bound by an agreement and must declare all conflicts of interest.

## Partnerships and collaborations

DOAJ partners with many organisations. The nature of the partnerships vary and may include membership, contracts for work, exchanges of information or services, initiative signatories, or access to information resources that assist DOAJ with our application review process.
