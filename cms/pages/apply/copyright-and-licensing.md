## Licensing

DOAJ recommends the use of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) licenses to inform readers how published content can be used. We do not specify which license should be used. You may select the Creative Commons license that best meets the needs of the journal, or give authors the option to choose a license for their paper. 

You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. This means you cannot impose restrictions on authors or users that conflict with the provisions of the license. Creative Commons licenses state clearly that "For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply".

In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.

## Copyright

The initial copyright of a paper is held by the authors (or their employer, in some instances). When publishing that paper the copyright may remain held by the author, or can be licensed or transferred to the publisher.

DOAJ recommends that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors will then grant the publisher the right of first publication, and other non-exclusive publishing rights.

Even when the author retains copyright, restrictions may sometimes be imposed by the publisher:

 - The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. The author no longer holds the copyright without restrictions.
 - The publisher requires a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive license of commercial rights. The author no longer retains copyright without restrictions.

## Understanding author rights

The terms of the Creative Commons (or other) license do not apply to the copyright holder. Therefore it is important to understand that:

 - when copyright is retained by the author without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher, but not to the author who can use their work in any way they choose.
 - when copyright is transferred to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author.
 - when the author retains copyright but grants exclusive publishing rights to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author.
 - when the author retains copyright but transfers or grants exclusive commercial rights to the publisher and a non-commercial license is used, the license applies to the readers and the author.

## Fair use

An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only. This is not open access and we will not accept a journal with these restrictions. A common example of fair use is when a journal allows authors to only retain the rights to:

 - use the substance of the article in future works, including lectures and books;
 - reproduce the article for one's own purposes, provided that copies are not offered for sale;
 - self-archive the article.
