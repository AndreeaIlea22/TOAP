## Licensing

We recommend that you use Creative Commons licenses to show your readers how the published content can be used. In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.

You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. For example, you cannot display on your website: ‘[Other conditions] will apply and prevail over all conflicting provisions of the [open access] license’ model. Creative Commons states clearly that '[For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)'.

## Copyright

We recommend that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors may grant the publisher non-exclusive publishing rights to publish the articles. Granting the publisher the right of first publishing also qualifies as unrestricted copyright (because there is no restriction imposed by the publisher on the author's copyright).

Restrictions are sometimes imposed by the publisher even though the author retains copyright:

 - The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. The author no longer holds the copyright without restrictions.
 - The publisher requires a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive grant of commercial rights. The author no longer retains copyright without restrictions.
