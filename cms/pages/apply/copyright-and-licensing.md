## Copyright

The initial copyright of a paper is held by the authors (or their employer, in some instances). When publishing that paper the copyright may continue to be held by the author, or can be licensed or transferred to the publisher.

DOAJ recommends that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors will then grant the publisher the right of first publication, and other non-exclusive publishing rights.

Even when the author retains copyright, restrictions may sometimes be imposed by the publisher:

 - The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. This means that the author no longer holds copyright without restrictions.
 - The publisher requires a transfer or exclusive license of commercial rights. This means the author no longer holds copyright without restrictions.

## Licensing

DOAJ recommends the use of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) licenses to inform readers how published content can be used. We do not specify which license should be used. You may [select the Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) that best meets the needs of the journal, or give authors the option to choose a license for their paper. 

You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. This means you cannot impose restrictions on authors or users that conflict with the provisions of the license. Creative Commons licenses [state clearly](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) that "For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply".

In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.

## Understanding author rights

**The terms of the Creative Commons (or other) license do not apply to the copyright holder.**

Therefore it is important to understand that:

When the author retains copyright without restrictions:

 - the license applies to the readers and the publisher 
 - the license does not apply to the author
 	
When the publisher has copyright transferred to them:
 
 - the license applies to the readers and the author
 	
When the author retains copyright and grants exclusive publishing rights to the publisher:
 
 - the license applies to the readers and the author
 	
When the author retains copyright, transfers or grants exclusive commercial rights to the publisher, and a non-commercial license is used:
 
 - the license applies to the readers and the author
 
## Fair use
 
**An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only.** This is not open access and we do not accept journals with these restrictions. 
 
An author cannot be restricted to fair use when:

 - they are the copyright holder
 - the publisher has copyright transferred to them, and the work is licensed with a CC license. The terms of the license apply to the author as well as other users.

Common incorrect restrictions of fair use are when a signed publishing agreement states that the author is only allowed to use the work in the classroom, or on a personal website, or place a copy in university repository.
