## Licensing

We recommend that you use Creative Commons licenses to show your readers how the published content can be used. In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.

You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. For example, you cannot display on your website: ‘[Other conditions] will apply and prevail over all conflicting provisions of the [open access] license’ model. Creative Commons states clearly that '[For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)'.

## Copyright

We recommend that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors may grant the publisher non-exclusive publishing rights to publish the articles. Granting the publisher the right of first publishing also qualifies as unrestricted copyright (because there is no restriction imposed by the publisher on the author's copyright).

Restrictions are sometimes imposed by the publisher even though the author retains copyright:

 - The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. The author no longer holds the copyright without restrictions.
 - The publisher requires a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive grant of commercial rights. The author no longer retains copyright without restrictions.

## The difficult bits about licensing and copyright together

The terms of the user license do not apply to the copyright holder. Therefore:

 - when copyright is retained by the author without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher.
 - when copyright is transferred to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author(s).
 - when the author retains copyright but commercial rights are transferred to the publisher and a non-commercial license is used, the license applies to the reader and the author.
 - when the author retains copyright but exclusive publishing rights are granted to the publisher, this is equivalent to the transfer of commercial rights to the publisher.

## Fair use

An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only. This is not open access and we will not accept a journal with these restrictions. A common example of fair use is when a journal allows authors to only retain the rights to:

 - use the substance of the article in future works, including lectures and books;
 - reproduce the article for one's own purposes, provided that copies are not offered for sale;
 - self-archive the article.
