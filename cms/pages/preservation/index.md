## Project JASPER (Journals are preserved forever)

Project JASPER is an initiative to preserve open access journals. It was launched on World Preservation Day 2020 and is in direct response to research that showed how online journals (open or closed access) are prone to disappearing from the internet due to a lack of understanding or resources to ensure that a journal is part of a long-term digital preservation scheme (or that it is "archived").

Phase One of Project JASPER is a partnership between CLOCKSS, DOAJ, Internet Archive, Keepers Registry and PKP and is a scoping exercise to find a solution which will reduce the number of open access journals that are not archived. Starting with a list of Diamond journals from DOAJ, the 5 partners are working together to produce a sustainable and reproducible process that will allow more and more journals to be archived and will allow more archiving services, represented by Keeper Registry, to connect to it.
