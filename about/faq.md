## Accessibility
ADD ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENTS HERE

If you disable all Javascript, searchingthe DOAJ won't work properly because some of the code that is required is served by Google's Javascript library hosting. Once disabled, search fails.

If you can select which components can be switched off, then you can continue to use DOAJ.

Another Javascript component is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which is the framework used to build the DOAJ website. This contains some Javascript for some of its features.
