    role: publisher
  setup:
    - You will require a publisher account with two journals, both of which have articles whose
      DOIs (or fulltexts) are represented in the test zip file's identifiers.csv file.  You want the
      articles in the zip file to represent articles from both journals, not just a single journal
  steps:
  - step: Ensure that the archive package has been created with correct structure
  - step: Ensure that the archive package contains more than one article with different journals. 
          A sample zip file is available for testing purpose. If there are no articles with the DOIs specified in the indentifiers.csv
          file in your DSoace instance, 
          the results may not be as expected. In that case unzip the file and update the identifiers.csv file with appropriate identifiers for the articles.
