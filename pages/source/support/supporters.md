We are proud that over 80% of DOAJ's funding comes from academic organisations (libraries, library consortia, universities, research centres). Without this vital support, we wouldn't be able to continue the high levels of service that the research community expects of us. We are grateful for the trust shown in us by our supporters.

The organisations listed here support DOAJ with an annual or a sustaining contribution. A sustaining contribution, one which secures more funding to DOAJ upfront, is discounted and is often over 3 years. Committing larger amounts of funding has a greater positive impact on DOAJ's future and allows for more sustainable development.
